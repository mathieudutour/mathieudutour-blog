A few months ago, someone asked me a very interesting question:

> What will the UI design process look like in the future?

I realised that even though I had worked on creating tools for designers for over 2 years now, I never really stopped to think about the future of the design tooling landscape before. Sure I had some ideas about what is not really working today and how to potentially fix some of it. But are those fixes fitting the future that I envisioned for the designer workflow? I didn’t know because I never asked myself that question.

I asked for a moment to gather my thoughts before answering the question but the only thing my brain could think about was “oh shit, I have no idea”. And that’s fair, it is a challenging question with no “right” answer. In the end, I babbled something about how AR, VR, and AI are going to change the way we design. The truth is, I didn’t know and couldn’t think of anything. I had no vision.

And boy, vision is primordial. When you have a vision of where you want to go, every decision becomes easier: does this help you realise your vision? Let me try to illustrate how important it is through three small examples:

-   A friend was working in a small startup founded by a CEO with very successful previous experiences. The thing is, those previous experiences were not really product focused and for the first time, the CEO needed to take product decisions. It turns out, all he wanted to do was to create a company to make money. There was no understanding of the users and how the product aligned with their needs and how those needs will evolved. Because the market opportunity was huge, the startup was doing okay. But the employees realised that the vision they had for the product was not shared by the others. Because the CEO didn’t have a vision, there were misunderstanding about the why. 
-   Perhaps the best example of someone driven by their vision is Elon Musk. Every ventures he is creating is born out of the vision he has of the future. // TODO \[wait but why neuralink\]
-   The third illustration is not related to startups. It’s politics. Let’s try not to talk about political opinions but about the lack of political vision in the discourse of today’s politics. A political vision is a potential future that you envision. It is often an utopia but has the merit of being a virtuous goal. That vision is how you want the society to be in the medium to long term. A campaign program (and every political decision thereafter) is simply a plan to realise that vision. Today’s debates are only about the details of the plan rather than the vision. I’m even claiming that a lot of politics do not have a vision they believe in. Mind you, I am not saying that debates about the implementation should not happen, I am saying that debates about the fundamental political visions are equally important and would make it easier to understand to disagreements when discussing the implementation.

The popular concept of lean startup is that you should iterate by small steps, following the feedback of the users. You are probably thinking that following a vision is the complete opposite of it and you would be right. // TODO

Let’s come back to the bullshit I answered to The Question. Something weird started to happened the following weeks: it kept bugging me and my mind was thinking of ways to answer when I was in bed.

The same way that when you are emotionally pressured/attacked, you sometimes can’t think of a good reply but then, later in your bed, you think “I should have said that, it would have been smart”. That’s pretty much happened, I couldn’t think of a good reply but my mind kept trying to find an answer. Slowly, a vision was forming. Of course, that only works when you kind of understand the field and are passionate about it (otherwise you won’t think about it when your brain has idle cpu clock to waste).

A vision is simply a (in)formed opinion about a potential future. To be a visionary, you need to have a vision. It takes a long time to form a vision but if you don’t start asking you what it is, you will never have one. The sooner you start to ask yourself, the sooner you will form an opinion and the more time you will have to iterate, argument that opinion.

So I’m asking you, What will the future of X look like? (Where X is something you care about)
